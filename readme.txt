A customizable search widget that autocompletes the titles of products, blog posts, events, or anything else you choose.

== Description ==

This plugin overrides standard HTML's (boring and uncustomizable) autofill feature with a pretty looking and highly functional alternative. It is entirely free, super lightweight, easy to configure, and looks smooth.

Search Autocomplete by Dotcomjungle works by creating a search widget that autofills from the titles of products, blog posts, events, pages, or anything else you choose. It utilizes Lea Verou's excellent [Awesomplete](https://leaverou.github.io/awesomplete/) to a create smooth, fast, and customizable autofill functionality. Search Autocomplete's features include:
* Autocomplete that matches anywhere in the text
* Customizable color themes to match your sites themes
* The ability to choose which post types will autofill
